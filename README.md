# libstreams


This project is intended to offer functionality to fetch streams from twitch and
strims easily. An example implementation of a server and client set up using
this library can be found at
[streamserver](https://github.com/HoppenR/streamserver) and
[streamshower](https://github.com/HoppenR/streamshower).
